- IMPORTANT: DO NOT USE `git`. Project is managed with jj scm, not git
- When formatting a simple variable, use `{varname}`
- NEVER add "🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)" or "Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>" to commits.
- *DO* *NOT* *USE* *GIT* ***EVER***. THIS IS NOT A GIT PROJECT!!!! Actually don't touch jj either.
- ALWAYS put `use` statements at the top of the file in the appropriate place, except for inlined test modules.
